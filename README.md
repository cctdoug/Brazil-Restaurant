### **Page 2: Menu**

A web application for a restaurant to calculate the cost of customer orders. 

- User (customer) generation: create at least 5 randomly generated user (customer) profiles for the customers 
using JSON data returned from the random user API. Using the random user API, https://randomuser.me/ to get data for the customers,
generating image thumbnails for the customers.

- Food cost: the application includes a form that allows the catering staff member to choose from a range of available menu items.
- The menu includes starters, main, dessert and drinks. Some of the guests may be vegetarian, so the starters and mains should contain at least 1 vegetarian menu item.
- Each menu item is an object containing: the dish name, a short (1 line) description, a suitable variable that indicates whether the dish is vegetarian, and the cost of the dish.
- A breakdown of the bill is returned to the catering staff member showing: the overall bill, a summary of each of the costs subdivided by starters, main, dessert and drinks.
a comparison of the cost of the vegetarian meals ordered vs the cost of the non-vegetarian meals – this is only calculated on the starters and mains.
